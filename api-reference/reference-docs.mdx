</ParamField>

<ParamField path="model" type="enum<string>
">
Available options: llama3-8b-8192 
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_tokens" type="integer | null">
The maximum number of **tokens** that can be generated in the completion. The token count of your plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="seed" type="integer | null">
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stop" type="string | null">
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stream" type="bollean | null">
//
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="temperature" type="number | null">
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="top_p" type="number | null">
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="user" type="string | null">
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.
</ParamField>

        "content": "Generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on generating new, original content, such as images, music, text, or videos. These models are trained on large datasets and learn to recognize patterns, relationships, and structures within the data, allowing them to generate new content that is similar in style, tone, or characteristics to the training data. \n \n Generative AI models can be categorized into two main types: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new content, while the discriminator evaluates the generated content and tells the generator whether it's realistic or not. VAEs are neural networks that learn to compress and reconstruct data. \n \n Generative AI has numerous applications across various industries, including art and design, content generation, data augmentation, and recommendation systems. Some examples of Generative AI in action include Deep Dream Generator, Amper Music, and DALL-E. \n \n In summary, Generative AI is a powerful technology that enables the creation of new, original content using machine learning models. It has the potential to revolutionize various industries and create new opportunities for artists, designers, and content creators.",
