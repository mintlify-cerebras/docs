<Note>`seed`, `temperature`, and `top_p` parameters are not currently available, but will be supported in later releases.</Note>

<ParamField path="choices" type="object[]" required="true">
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="model" type="enum<string>" required="true">
Available options: `llama3.1-8b`, `llama3.1-70b` 
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="max_tokens" type="integer | null">
The maximum number of **tokens** that can be generated in the completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="seed" type="integer | null">
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stop" type="string | null">
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="stream" type="boolean | null">
If set, partial message deltas will be sent.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="temperature" type="number | null">
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="top_p" type="number | null">
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So, 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="user" type="string | null">
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help to monitor and detect abuse.
</ParamField>
